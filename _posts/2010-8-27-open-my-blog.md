What a wonderful day! Finally, I opened my blog at github. I wanted to own a
blog a long time ago, especially when I saw a nice blog, but I thought it was
too difficult. Thanks to open source, there are many styles I can refer to.

Now I only need to write my blogs in markdown with vim editor, nothing else I
need to care about. Though the blog isn't perfect, it is enough for me. I
think the simpler the better, because that means I can concentrate on content,
rather than forms.

It's really good, just think about that I can share my documents and joy with
others when I own the blog.

That's all. I will often update my blog, and I will also add some small stuff
to decorate it and make it pretty.
